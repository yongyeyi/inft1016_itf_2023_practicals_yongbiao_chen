Description

My content is about the introduction of birds and the sharing of some bird pictures
I want more people to learn about birds
I think a white background will make people read more easily, and adding many kinds of colors will make people tired of reading the content.

Methods
root is to create a palette.
If you are not satisfied with a color, you can quickly change it if you use root.
Use localStorage to do some local data storage.
I set up four different buttons inside to display photos of different birds through this.
Two different themes were made to facilitate people to read at different times.
Center-aligned formatting is made easier to read by flex.
Using localStorage will make it easier for users to read and will keep the last used themes.Even if the user's name is changed the theme will not revert to the default theme.

I feel that more people will be made aware of the knowledge and benefits of birds. I believe the result will be more and more people to protect birds.
